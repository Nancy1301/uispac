Here are the changes I am thinking of:

1. Have a button for users to upload the input files ( The file you are generating the graphs and charts from)
2. create a drop down list of what graph the user wants to see.
3. Create a text box where user can enter a show description , later this will have to connect to backend and return a list of recommendations.
